## Production Possibilities and Opprtunity Cost

### PPF

> `The production possibilities frontier (PPF)` is the boundary between those combinations of goods and services that can be produced and that cannot.

- Ceteris Paribus: focus on two goods and hold the quantities of all other goods and services constant.

- Status:

  - inside of PPF is attainable

    Inefficient: at such points, resources are either unemployed or misallocated. More of one good can be produced without producing less of the other good.

  -  ouside is unattainable.

  - Move along the PPF inloves a *tradeoff*.

    Production efficiency: points on the frontier are efficient.

- From Cola side

  The opportunity cost of the first 5 million cans of cola is 1 million pizzas.

:::{note}
The opportunity cost of a can of cola is the **inverse** of the opportunity cost of a pizza.
