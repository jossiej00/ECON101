# Chap.2 Demand and Supply Analysis 

## Production Possibilities and Opprtunity Cost

### PPF

> `The production possibilities frontier (PPF)` is the boundary between those combinations of goods and services that can be produced and that cannot.

- Ceteris Paribus: focus on two goods and hold the quantities of all other goods and services constant.

- Status:

  - inside of PPF is attainable

    Inefficient: at such points, resources are either unemployed or misallocated. More of one good can be produced without producing less of the other good.

  -  ouside is unattainable.

  - Move along the PPF inloves a *tradeoff*.

    Production efficiency: points on the frontier are efficient.


### Opportunity Cost

- Descriptions

  - From Pizza side

    The opportunity cost of the fifth 1 million pizzas is 5 million cans of cola.

  - From Cola side

    The opportunity cost of the first 5 million cans of cola is 1 million pizzas.

- The opportunity cost of a can of cola is the **inverse** of the opportunity cost of a pizza.

OC of A = $\frac{\Delta B}{\Delta A}$

## Using Resources Efficiently

> By comapring costs and benefits, the determination on which of the alternative efficient quantities to produce could be made.

### Marginal Cost

> The `Marginal Cost` of a good or service is the opportuity cost of producing **one** more unit of it.

### Marginal Benefit

> The `Marginal Benefit` of a good or service is the benefit received from consuming **one** more unit of it. It's used to describe `preferences` and mesured by the amount that a person is willing to pay for an additional unit of a good or service.

- `principle of decreasing marginal benefit` means the more we have of any good, the smaller is its marginal benefit and the less we are willing to pay for an additional unit of it.

The `Marginal benefit curve` slopes downward to reflect the principle of decreasing marginal benefit.

### Allocative Efficiency

>  `Allocative Efficiency` is achieved when we cannot produce more of any one good without giving up some other good that pdovide greater benefit.

- The point of allocative efficiency is the point on the PPF at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost.
- We cannot get more value from our resources.
- On the PPF at the point where pizzas produced is 2.5 mill, we are producing the efficient quantities of cola and pizzas.

- We get more value from our resources by producing more pizzas.
- On the PPF at point B, e.g., we are producing too much cola, and we are better off moving along the PPF to produce more pizzas.

- We get more value from our resources by producing fewer pizzas.
- On the PPF at point E, e.g., we are producing too many pizzas, and we are better off moving along the PPF to produce fewer pizzas.

## Gains from Trade

### Comparative Advantage

> A person has a `comparative advantage` in an activity if that person can perform the activity **at a lower opportunity cost** than anyone else.

Assume: Joe spends 10 minutes making salads and 50 minutes making smoothies, so he produces 5 smoothies and 5 salads an hour; Liz's customers buy salads and smoothies in equal number,  so she produces 15 smoothies and 15 salads an hour.

- **Joe's opportunity cost of a salad is $\frac{1}{5}$** smoothie.
- Joe's opportunity cost of a smoothie is 5 salads.

```

- Joe has a comparative advantage in producing salads.
- Liz has a comparative advantage in producing smoothies.

Less OC, greater comparative advantage.

### Absolute Advantage

>A person has an `absolute advantage` if that person is **more productive** than others.
