**Course Objectives:**

 

This course introduces students to the economic way of thinking and the principles of microeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of individual markets and the behavior of individual agents such as consumers, business firms, and the government. We begin with the fundamental ideas of trade-offs and opportunity cost. Next we introduce supply and demand, the forces that determine prices and quantities in the markets for goods and services, and demand and supply elasticities. We then examine situations where market outcomes are socially beneficial and situations where markets fail. Next we study how government policy may make our economy less or more efficient, that is, when and where government succeeds or fails. Then, we turn our focus on to explaining the global market – how it works, winners, losers and the net gain from trade, and trade restrictions. Next our attention is to explain externalities – negative and positive externality. Finally, we will turn our focus on to firm and production side – how business firms choose production levels to maximize profits and the effect of different market structures (e.g. perfect competition, monopoly market) on economic outcomes.

 

Econ 101 contains quite a bit of algebra and graphical analysis, however, ultimately the focus will be on economic applications/interpretations.

 

**Educational Objectives and Learning Outcomes**

 

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

 

1. Discuss economic problems in terms of scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost.

2. Learning the fundamental ideas of trade-offs.

3. Analyze the impact of changes in exogenous variables using demand-supply analysis.

4. Explain how government regulations affect the operation of markets.

5. Develop elasticity concepts as measures of sensitivity.

6. Apply global market concept in determining the winners and losers from trade.

7. Understand positive and negative externality

 

8. Identify the characteristic differences between various market structures including perfect competition and imperfect competition.

Final Exam   (TBA)   50%

TOTAL   100%

Note: Exams will, in principle, require in-person attendance. However, I reserve the right (depending on situation, especially the Covid-19 situation) to implement online alternatives at a later date, or move them online entirely. Anyway, you will be notified in-class or by email if exams are changed from in-person to online.

 

**Participation & I-Clicker Tests:**

 

Participation in class-activities is highly recommended and it carries some points. The studies show that the students regularly participating in class-activities do much better in the exams than the students who do not. Power point presentations containing a limited amount of information will be posted on UBC-Canvas, but most of the important issues will be discussed in the class. The pre-condition to participate in class-activities is your attendance from the beginning to the end of a class. I-Clicker tests that will verify your participation will be taken at some randomly selected dates. Any excuse of missing a particular I-clicker test is not possible to consider, but the total weight for I-clicker test can be transferred to the final if you have strong and acceptable reasons; needless to mention that your weight for Participation & I-Clicker Tests will be transferred to the final if you cannot attend the class due to COVID-19 related issues.

 

You have to create a i-clicker account. The link for guide to open an account is:

 

https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/iclicker-cloud-student-guide/

 

You can use iClicker Cloud on the web page at: https://student.iclicker.com/#/login

 

or you can download the iClicker Student app for mobile device.

 

Note that you will have to give your student ID number somewhere while you follow the steps to create the i-clicker account, or I won’t be able to find you. Note also that your name for I-clicker account must be the same with your name on Canvas for this course.

 

If you have any issue, please talk with Arts ISIT help desk.

**Midterm Tests:** Midterm tests will be held on the stated dates. A midterm test will be comprehensive/cumulative, i.e. all the chapters/topics covered up until an exam date for a midterm will be tested. Should you miss a midterm test without prior consultation with me or have no valid reason(s) (doctor’s note required in the case of sickness), you will receive a grade of zero for the affected test. Please note that UBC exam policy applies to an exam, midterm or final. Those who with prior consultation or valid reasons miss a midterm, their marks for the affected midterm will be transferred to the final-exam; **no make-up test**. Once a midterm’s grades are posted, you will be given a period of time to check your grade from your TA.

 

**Final Exam:** The final exam will be comprehensive (cumulative) and will be written during the University’s final exam period. You are supposed to be notified the date and venue of your final exam in due course by the Registrar/Exam office. Writing the final exam is obligatory to pass this course.

 

**Grading Policy:** In accordance with the VSE grading policy for 100-level courses, the average grade for this course will be between 67% and 71%. Grades may be curved upwards or downwards in order to ensure compliance with the policy.

 

**Course Web Centre**

 

There is a website for this course on Canvas. All exercise questions, course announcements, PowerPoint slides and so on, will be posted on Canvas. I expect students will check the Canvas course website regularly.

 

**Feedback:** During the semester, your comments on this course are welcomed. When something is not clear during lectures, do not hesitate to ask or see me during office hours or by appointment.

 

 

 

**S****OME** **G****ENERAL RULES**

 

**Laptop and Tablet Use**

You must not use laptops during **in-person** lectures unless I ask for it. There are some reasons for this:

 

·    Laptop use during an **in-person** class generates significant distractions for those using them and for others.

 

·    Recent research (e.g., Mueller and Oppenheimer, 2014) shows that students who use laptops during **in-person** class to take notes perform worse than the students who take notes longhand.

 

If you have a pen-enabled tablet (e.g., a Microsoft Surface Pro) that allows you to write or annotate documents by hand, you may use it during **in-person** class as long as it is flat on the desk.

 

**Phone Use**

All phones must be switched off during an **in-person** class.

**Academic Accommodations**: Students who need academic accommodation should check the guidelines and follow the procedures found at the Access & Diversity Centre’s website: [http://www.students.ubc.ca/access/drc.cfm/. ](http://www.students.ubc.ca/access/drc.cfm/)If you are accepted, Access & Diversity office will notify me about the acceptance.

 

**Academic Integrity**: You are expected to be honest in your academic work. Cheating on assignments or examinations will not be tolerated. Cheating activities will be punished according to the university rule. UBC’s policies on academic conduct and honesty are available in the Calendar, at [http://www.students.ubc.ca/calendar/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0, ](http://www.students.ubc.ca/calendar/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0)then [Vancouver Academic Calendar,](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/) then [Campus-wide Policies and Regulations, ](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,0,0,0)and then [Student Conduct and Discipline. ](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,0,0)Be sure you are familiar with these policies, as they will be followed in this course.

**Study Tips: The following tips may help you do well in this and other courses**

 

·    Plan to spend a minimum of ten hours a week (not including class time) on this course, and all your courses to keep up with the material and get enough practice. Developing sound problem-solving skills via practice is extremely important in economics.

 

·    Do not fall behind; keep up with the material on a daily basis; you need to apply your new economics skills every day.

 

·    Read the assignments carefully by keeping pen and paper at your side to work out the various points being made (this is a good idea for any course you take). Redraw every graph to make sure you understand how the graph works and what it shows.

 

·    Spread you studying over several days and quiz yourself on the relevant material before exams. These are highly effective learning strategies shown to boost student performance on exams. Highlighting and rereading chapters provide minimal improvements to learning. Instead of rereading use self or group quizzes.

 

·    Come to office hours to ask questions on a regular basis. Do not put off attending office hours until the day before the exam – it gets too crowded at those times.

 

·    Some part of your studying should be done in small groups of two or three students. Students who study on their own then discuss their work in groups of no more than three understand the material better and feel more engaged with their classes.

 

·    Get to know your professor. Studies show that students who get to know their professor feel more connected to the college, understand the material better and get better grades.

 

·    When you come to office hours ask specific questions; for instance, “Where did I go wrong in calculating the multiplier?” not “Why didn’t I get a better grade?”

 

·    Do not hide academic problems. Studies show that students who ask for help improve their grades and those who do not spiral downward – isolated, failing and unhappy.

 

·    Consider how much time you are devoting to studying for this course. Studies show that students who do well in courses always mention the time they spent studying for the course in evaluations of their experience.

Students who do poorly never mention time. That is, students who did poorly have never thought about the best way to allocate their time. On a daily basis, you should be thinking about how much time you allocate to this course, the quality of the time you spend studying, when you are going to study and so on.

 

·    Utilize all the resources available to you to help you learn the material; lectures, discussion sections, on-line videos, office hours and study groups. In addition, AMS Tutoring provides free drop-in tutoring at several locations on campus.
